# Asynchronous JavaScript, Ajax and Fetch API

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Asychronous tools allow users to continue processing other requests or executing other code without waiting for one request/execution to complete.

Promises, which we will learn more about when using the Fetch API, also provides help when dealing with asynchronous requests.

## Ajax

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

It allows users to accomplish a few things, such as, reading data from a web server after a page has loaded, updating a web page without the need to reload the whole page, and sending back information to a web server asynchronously (in the background).

AJAX uses the XMLHttpRequest object to accomplish these various tasks.

## Fetch API

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching content or resources across the internet.

It returns a promise, which represent the resulting value of an asynchronous operation in case of a successful and a value that represents the failure of the request.
